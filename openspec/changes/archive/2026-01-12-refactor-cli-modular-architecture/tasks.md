## 1. Documentation
- [x] 1.1 Create `openspec/specs/cli-architecture/spec.md` with modular architecture requirements
- [x] 1.2 Document current decomposition state (database commands completed)
- [x] 1.3 Document command routing mechanism in main script
- [x] 1.4 Document module structure conventions and patterns
- [x] 1.5 Identify remaining code in main script that could be further decomposed

## 2. Validation
- [x] 2.1 Run `openspec validate refactor-cli-modular-architecture --strict`
- [x] 2.2 Verify all database commands work correctly after decomposition
- [x] 2.3 Confirm main script routing logic is correct
